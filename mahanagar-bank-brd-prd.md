|**1**|**Executive Summary**|
| :- | :- |

## **1.1  Purpose**
This Business & Product Requirements Document (BRD/PRD) defines the complete scope, goals, user stories, page inventory, component specifications, and technical requirements for the redesign and enhancement of the Mahanagar Nagrik Sahakari Bank (MNS Bank) website at mnsbankbhopal.com. It is the single source of truth for all design, development, and QA work on this project and is structured for direct input to Spec Kit or equivalent specification tooling.

## **1.2  Business Problem**
MNS Bank's current website fails on three dimensions critical to a cooperative bank in 2026:

- Functional incompleteness — 10+ navigation items lead to empty or broken pages, including all Digital Services pages and several Loan product pages.
- Regulatory non-compliance — The DEAF/Unclaimed Deposits page is blank (a mandatory RBI disclosure). No Grievance Redressal page with RBI Ombudsman link exists. No KFS (Key Facts Statement) on loan pages. Multiple RBI-mandated policy documents are absent.
- Trust & credibility gap — Stale copyright (2021), typos on the homepage, a non-standard HTTPS port for Net Banking (8444), and no Annual Reports or membership information undermine customer confidence.

## **1.3  Strategic Objectives**
The enhanced website must achieve the following strategic objectives:

1. Complete every product and service page with accurate, benefit-led content.
1. Achieve full RBI compliance for UCB digital disclosure requirements as of March 2026.
1. Deliver a modern, mobile-first visual design modelled on the reference template (tjsbbank.co.in) using MNS Bank's own brand identity.
1. Enable digital customer acquisition via inline inquiry forms and self-service tools.
1. Establish SEO foundations and local search presence for Bhopal.
1. Support both English and Hindi languages across all pages.

*All SP pages require unique, SEO-friendly URL slugs. All CP pages must serve both Personal and Business contexts via clearly labelled tabs or sections.*

### **Navigation Architecture**
The site uses a dual top-level tab structure. Each tab exposes five consistent sub-navigation categories:

- Shared sections: About Us · Other Services · Compliance & Footer

|**9**|**Assumptions, Dependencies & Constraints**|
| :- | :- |

## **9.1  Assumptions**
1. The bank holds rights to all images, logos, and content to be published on the website.
1. All interest rates and fees published will be approved by bank management and comply with RBI guidelines before publication.
1. A designated content approver will be nominated by bank management before Phase 2 begins to review and sign off all product page content.

1. The existing domain (mnsbankbhopal.com) and hosting contract will be retained for the project duration.
1. 'Other Services' pages (Insurance, Mutual Funds, Demat, ASBA) will only be built and published for services MNS Bank is currently licensed or empanelled to offer.
1. The Grievance Redressal Policy document exists internally and will be provided by the Legal/Compliance team for web publication by end of Week 1.

- Hindi translator: engaged and briefed by start of Phase 2.

## **9.3  Constraints**
